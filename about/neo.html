                    <span class="htext">~~ History / Her Creation</span>
                    <br><img src="/images/abt/animegen2.png" align="right" width="30%"><span align="right">
                        <figcaption>2020</figcaption>
                    </span>I originally created Neo in early 2020 with a <a
                        href="https://khmix.sakura.ne.jp/download.shtml">character generator from K.Hmix
                        (キャラクターなんとか機)</a>. However, she was less of a character and more of just a cute avatar I used at
                    the time.
                    <br><br>It was not until the summer of 2020 that I would begin to treat Neo as a proper character.
                    During this stage, she received the name Neo, I used her as an online persona, and I started
                    modifying her design. I kept many aspects from the original generation that would persist into her
                    present incarnation, such as her nun-like collar and ahoge.
                    <br><br><img src="/images/abt/neo-chibi3.gif" align="left" width="30%">Although this modified
                    version of the design retained the original's pigtails, I felt unsatisfied and would experiment with
                    her hair in late 2020. I also decided that she would be a <u>vampire</u> angel around this time.
                    This is because I like angels and vampires. I liked vampires especially in 2020. Her status as a
                    vampire angel did not have much bearing on her character.
                    <br><br>You might notice that her personality has not changed much since
                    its inception. I have mainly altered her interests, as they were identical to mine (being a persona
                    and all...).
                    <br><br>

                        <figcaption>2021</figcaption>
                    </span>This is where you could say that Neo stagnated... or crystallized? Her 2021 self is extremely
                    similar to her modern self. This period was kickstarted after I became very interested in vtubing
                    (making videos with a virtual avatar) and made a Live2D model of Neo.
                    <br><br>I would create accounts,
                    channel assets, etc, but this vtubing idea never came to fruition. However, she gained some
                    separation from myself as a mascot and lost her vampire proclivities. ~FULL ANGEL MODE~ yeuy ^__^
                    <br><br><img src="/images/abt/neo-wiggly-wave-2.gif" width="30%" align="left"
                        style="image-rendering:pixelated;">Her design
                    went through several minor adjustments, the most notable being the addition of
                    crosses on her collar, her switch to mary janes, and her "untied" hairstyle being reinterpreted as
                    what I liked to call "hair wings". They did not flap, or do anything winglike at all, but it seemed
                    like a suitable title. The shape of the hair wings was less defined (more limp/curvy) than now.
                    Also, I made her nurse outfit. It had no significance outside of being an alernate outfit.
                    <br><br><img src="/images/abt/neo doods transparent.png" align="right" width="30%">The first version
                    of Neo's backstory spawned here. She was a guardian angel who sucked at her job (did something silly
                    like slipping on a banana peel while running to push her guard-ee out of a car's path) so she was
                    cast out of Heaven and left to find a new purpose on Earth.
                    <br><br>Since this was my vtubing dream period,
                    her new purpose was playing video games. Or making videos about my interests? Who knows...
                    <br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                    <center><img src="/images/abt/fack you.gif" width="40%"> <img src="/images/abt/nurseoutfit.gif"
                            width="40%"></center>
                            <br><img src="/images/abt/the sad white angel transparent.png" align="right" width="30%"><span align="right">
                        <figcaption>2022 ~ 2024</figcaption>I became particularly unsatisfied with Neo during this period, but I couldn't place why. I think her design was too simple and I didn't feel like I was approrpiately tapping into her moe-ness... I was also disappointed that I could not create a world/story which I liked for her.
                        <br><br>Neo's only significant design changes during this time were the addition of a cross pendant on her collar (+ removal of the old collar crosses), back-and-forth on juliet sleeves (like her original generation), plushie loss, and straight bangs.
                        <br><br><img src="/images/abt/angelbit concept.png" width="15%" align="left"><img src="/images/abt/bottom-angelbit.gif" width="15%" align="right">I wanted to turn her bear IV into an actual creature, but I wasn't sure what to do with it. I ended up with these chao-inspired things called Angelbits. I might re-use them.
                        <br><br><img src="/images/abt/neo-headbang3.gif" width="30%" align="left" style="image-rendering:pixelated;">HEAVENWURLD was also created during this period, but its lore would not extend past "7-layered world with angels" until 2024.
